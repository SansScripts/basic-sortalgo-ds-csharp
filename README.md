# SortingAlgorithms-DataStructures-InCSharp

This repository contains a collection of basic sorting algorithms and data structures implemented in C#. The purpose of this project is to provide a reference and educational resource for understanding and implementing these fundamental concepts in programming.

## Sorting Algorithms

The project includes the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

Each sorting algorithm is implemented as a separate class and provides a method to sort an array of integers.

## Data Structures

The project includes the following data structures:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue

Each data structure is implemented as a separate class and provides common operations for manipulating and accessing the data.

## Usage

To use the sorting algorithms or data structures, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment.
3. Explore the different classes representing sorting algorithms and data structures.
4. Use the provided methods to perform sorting or data manipulation as needed.
5. Customize or extend the code to suit your specific requirements.


The SortingAlgorithms/ directory contains implementation files for various sorting algorithms, including BubbleSortExample.cs, InsertionSortExample.cs, MergeSortExample.cs, QuickSortExample.cs, and HeapSortExample.cs. These files provide code examples and demonstrations of each sorting algorithm.

The DataStructures/ directory includes implementation files for fundamental data structures. It contains ArrayExample.cs, LinkedListExample.cs, StackExample.cs, and QueueExample.cs, each showcasing the implementation and usage of the respective data structure.

The root directory also contains additional files such as BinarySearchExample.cs, demonstrating the implementation of a binary search algorithm, Program.cs, serving as the entry point of the application, and SortingAlgorithms-DataStructures-InCSharp.csproj, representing the project file that defines its structure and dependencies.
